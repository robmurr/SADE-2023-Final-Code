# NEAT-Pong-Python
Using the NEAT algorithm to train an AI to play pong in Python!

## This project was developed during the Summer 2023 SADE Program at Discovery Lab Global
## Details
This project was developed by a 3-person team (Quicksilver) using python to first build a functional "Pong" game.
After continuous research of different AI models, through trial-and-error this project was completed using the NEAT algorithm to train the AI agent to master and perfect the game.
The full process and findings throughout this program were all recorded in the 480-page document found in this repository.
